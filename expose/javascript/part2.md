# question 1
it should print the value of i after the loop which is 3.

# question 2
it should print out the last discountedPrice that was calculated in the loop which is 150.

# question 3
it should print out the last finalPrice that was calculated in the loop which was 150

# question 4
it should return the array of discounted prices that were calculated in the function which is [50,100,150]

# question 5
it should error out since i is not defined outside of the for loop block.

# question 6
it should error out since discountedPrice is not defined outside of the for loop block.

# question 7
it should print out the last finalPrice that was calculated in the loop which was 150

# question 8
it should return the array of discounted prices that were calculated in the function which is [50,100,150]

# question 9
it should error out since i is not defined outside of the for loop block.

# question 10
it should print out the length of the array of prices which in this case is 3

# question 11
it should return the array of discounted prices that were calculated in the function which is [50,100,150]

# question 12
A. student.name
B. student["Grad Year"]
C. student.greeting()
D. student["Favorite Teacher"].name
E. student.courseload[0]

# question 13
A. '3' + 2 = '32' since integers map to their exact string representation
B. '3' - 2 = 1 since strings map to their exact integer representation
C. 3 + null = 3 since null maps to 0
D. '3' + null = '3null' since null also maps to the string 'null'
E. true + 3 = 4 since true maps to 1
F. false + null = 0 since both false and null map to 0
G. '3' + undefined = '3undefined' since undefined maps to the string 'undefined'
H. '3' - undefined = NaN since '3' maps to the integer 3 and undefined maps to NaN as an integer

# question 14
'2' > 1 = true since the integer comparison 2 > 1 is true
'2' < '12' = false since the string '2' is greater than '1'
2 == '2' = true since the string '2' maps to the integer 2
2 === '2' = false since 2 and '2' are not the same type
true == 2 = false since true maps to the integer 1 and 1 != 2
true === Boolean(2) = true since the boolean of any value that is not 0 or empty is true 

# question 15 
the == check the equivalence of 2 variables after a type conversion while === does not do a type conversion
